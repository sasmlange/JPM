Introduction
======================

JPM (`J*`_ Package Manager) is a package manager of `J*`_. The documentation for
`J*`_ can be found here: https://bamless.github.io/jstar. Please note that JPM
is not an official program of `J*`_. JPM was only made to add libraries to
`J*`_. Currently, JPM only works on windows (Sorry Mac and Unix).
